# [OSSIRA - E-Commerce Website](https://ossira.herokuapp.com/)

This is an ecommerce website for an imaginary brand Ossira, a high end shoe store. Users should be able to navigate through the website, add products to the cart and checkout without the need of having an account. This app has a search bar available for users to search products by name or type of shoe. If the user wants to add products to a wishlist or access their wishlist, they will be instructed to create an account. Users that have an account can also see their order's history.

This app was created using React, React-Redux, CSS, JavaScript, Axios, Express, Sequelize, Node.js, Formik, Bcrypt, JSON Web Token, PostgreSQL and Heroku.
